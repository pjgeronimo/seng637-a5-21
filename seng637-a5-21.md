# Introduction

The goal of this lab is to explore the ways to assess failure data including reliability growth testing (part 1) and assessment using a reliability demonstration chart (part 2)

For part 1 this involves using a growth assessment tool. For this lab, the tool selected was C-SFRAT as for its user-friendly interface and easy setup. With this tool, the given test data will be imported to assess various models and measure and discuss the failure rate, MTTF and reliability metrics.

In part 2, a reliability demonstration chart tool will be used to determine if the target failure or MTTF criteria is met. The tool will give insight to the reliability trend of the SUT.

These two methods will be discussed and compared for their effectiveness as reliability tools.
